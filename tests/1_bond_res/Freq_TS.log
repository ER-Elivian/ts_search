          EVOLUTION
 IN THE BEGINNING GOD MADE MAN.
 HE WORKED THE DIRT WITH HIS HANDS.
 THEN GOD DECIDED TO GIVE MAN SCIENCE,
 MAN SHOULD BE USEFUL (LIKE AN APPLIANCE.)
 BUT SOON MAN'S KNOWLEDGE GREW TOO GREAT,
 TO THE HEADING SCIENCE HE COULDN'T RELATE
 SO GOD SAID "LETS HAVE DIFFERENT FIELDS,
 WE'LL DIVIDE THEM UP, SEE WHAT IT YIELDS."
 ENTER PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, BIO
 THEY SPRANG UP AROUND THE NILE.
 BUT CHEMISTRY SURPASSED THE REST
 FAR AND AWAY IT WAS THE BEST.
 EXPERIMENT WAS GOD'S DECREE
 EXPERIMENT DID CHEMISTS WITH LOTS OF GLEE
 BUT SOON THEIR TESTS BEGAN TO BOG,
 THEY FOUND THEMSELVES DEEP IN A FOG.
 "GIVE US SOME HELP" THEY CRIED TO GOD.
 GOD LOOKED AROUND, THEN GAVE THE NOD.
 ENTER EINSTEIN, HEISENBERG, BOHR,
 REACTION PATHS WERE CLEAR ONCE MORE.
 WITH THEORISTS GOD SEND DIRECTION
 AND THEN HE STOPPED, HE'D MADE PERFECTION.
